# Project Overview

This Project is a Part of Front End NanoDegree by Udacity. In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application had already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The task was to write several test suites such as: 'The menu', 'Initial Entries', 'New Feed Selection' and specs on it.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass. It's an important skill to have!
